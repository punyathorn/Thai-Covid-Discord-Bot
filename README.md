# Thai-Covid-Discord-Bot-Example
## DISCLAIMER
This may not work any api break changes made by the government and any new discord.py break changes.

## NOTE
This project is discontinued. I might rewrite it in the future.

An COVID-19 Checker Discord Bot Example (for Thailand only) made with Discord.py using the DDC OpenData Api provided by the government.

## Features
Acts as a discord bot that scrapes data of COVID-19 stats in Thailand and sends the data upon the messaging events when the user sends the command to the bot.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to a folder.
2. Extract the Zip file.
3. Make a discord bot and invite it into a designated server. (If haven't made)
4. Using any editor, edit line 38 with the bot's token found in Discord Developer Portal and line 39 with your timezone identifier in the table found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
5. Run the program file.
6. In the any channel in that server that the bot has access to, send the message command "get covid".
7. Wait for the bot to respond!
